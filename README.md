## MicroMDM (Docker)

Simple docker container for [MicroMDM][1].  MicroMDM is simple to run, as it is contained within a single binary, but I still thought there was a need to have a small docker container that had a bit of intelligence to it.

There are at least 2 folders you would want to map into the container (or use a data container for).  You can easily migrate from a dedicated instance to a dockerized version by pointing the container to your pre-existing folders.

For the certificates we use defaults of :
```
/certs
  /certs/mdm_push_cert.pem
  /certs/ProviderPrivateKey.key
```
Use this folder also will contain your own TLS cert and key file if you opt to use one.  The `TLS_CERT` and `TLS_KEY` environment variable should match the name of the file(s) that you places in the `/certs` folder.

You can see the logs of the running container by using `docker logs` for example:
```
docker logs micromdm
```

### Example Usage

```
docker run -d --restart always --name micromdm \
  -e APNS_PASSWORD=secret \
  -e SERVER_URL=https://micromdm.acme.com \
  -e API_KEY=abcdef1234567890 \
  -e TLS_CERT=micromdm.acme.com.crt \
  -e TLS_KEY=micromdm.acme.com.key \
  -e TLS=true \
  -v /root/certs:/certs \
  -v /root/micromdm:/config \
  -v /root/mdmrepo:/repo \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  sphen/micromdm
```

### Environment Variables

Variable | Description
--- | ---
API_KEY | Define your API key (Optional)
APNS_PASSWORD | APNS p12 cert password
DEBUG | Set to `true` to enable `-http_debug`
SERVER_URL | Public HTTPS url of your server
TLS | Set to `true` to enable HTTPS (Defaults to False)
TLS_CERT | TLS certificate file name (within mapped /certs directory)
TLS_KEY |TLS private key file name (within mapped /certs directory)

### Mapped Volumes

Path | Description
--- | ---
/certs | Folder containing `mdm_push_cert.pem`, `ProviderPrivateKey.key` and TLS certificates (Optional)
/config | Folder containing micromdm configuration
/repo | Folder for http file repo

### Ports

80, 443, 8080

Ports 80/443 used if TLS enabled.  Otherwise serves on port 8080.

### Ideas

Throw a caddy container in front! :)
